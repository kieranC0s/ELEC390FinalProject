# Phyphox Accelerometer Classifier
This project is a desktop application that uses data collected from a smartphone's accelerometer to distinguish between 'walking' and 'jumping'. The application takes in accelerometer data in CSV format, and outputs a CSV file containing the labels ('walking' or 'jumping') for the corresponding input data. The system uses logistic regression as a simple classifier for this classification task.
